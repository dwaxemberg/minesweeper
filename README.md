MineSweeper application written in java. 

I originally wrote this app as a challenge to create Mine Sweeper with a GUI
during the course of one of my Software Craftsmanship lectures. It turns out
we had a shortened lecture that day and in 20 minutes I had almost functional
Mine Sweeper. I have since rewritten most of it and have decided to make it a
little nicer.
